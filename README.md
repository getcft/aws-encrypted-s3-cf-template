[![CloudFormation Validation](https://github.com/getcft/aws-encrypted-s3-cf-template/actions/workflows/cloudformation-validation.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/getcft/aws-encrypted-s3-cf-template//actions/workflows/cloudformation-validation.yml)

## Description:

This solution creates an encrypted [AWS S3 Bucket](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) leveraging a [AWS KMS](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/) key.

The AWS CloudFormation template creates a AWS KMS encryption key for S3, and an encrypted S3 bucket leveraging the KMS key.

When you use server-side encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts an object before saving it to disk in its data centers and decrypts it when you download the objects.

AWS S3 server-side encryption uses one of the strongest block ciphers available, 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-256), to encrypt your data.

_***note AWS S3 and AWS KMS will incur costs**_
